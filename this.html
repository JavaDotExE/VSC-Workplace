                Advantages of the ABM Strand
                Learn the pros of taking the K-12 ABM strand this school year. The following are the advantages of taking this strand.

                1. Fosters Learner-Centered Programs
                    With the K-12 program, the students have the freedom to choose among the four K-12 tracks. Their active role in choosing the track aims to teach the values of independence and responsibility. Since they are the one who chose the track, it’s also part of their duty to study the required subjects and complete the track programs.

                2. Provides Direct Path to Careers
                    One of the goals of K-12 in the Philippines is to lead more students to their chosen careers. Many Filipinos are not able to pursue college due to various reasons. Based on data from the Department of Education (DepEd), close to 4 million students were not able to enroll for the current school year (PNA, 2021). K-12 seeks to bridge this gap through programs that will produce job-ready graduates each year.

                3. Boosts Interest for Tertiary Learning
                    Aside from preparing them for work, the ABM track programs aim to encourage students to advance their learning through college degrees and skill courses. The ABM track subjects provide a glimpse of the careers ahead of them. Although they know the basics of ABM, gaining a higher degree can open more job opportunities.

                4. Helps with Career Decision Making
                    Before, most high school students would experience a hard time choosing their college courses; with lack of awareness about the courses and tracks among the reasons behind frequent course shifting. With the K-12 program, senior high school students could explore arts, science, technical, and sports courses. Through this, they will have a better grasp of their college course choice and a clearer career path view.

                5. Advances Skills in the Job Market.
                    Part of the K-12 ABM track program’s goals is to increase the education quality in the country. The track subjects aim to shape fresh graduates who are globally competitive and are set to win a spot in today’s job market.
